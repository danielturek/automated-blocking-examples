### Automated Blocking Examples

Scripts and data files for reproducing examples of automated parameter blocking for efficient MCMC sampling.

All examples may be run using the shell script run-examples.sh

R scripts for each individual analysis are in code folder, and may be run directly through R

R data files containing results are written to results folder

To fully reproduce results appearing the Automated Parameter Blocking for Efficient MCMC Sampling manuscript, the input values in some scripts (e.g., computational efficiency simulation) will have to modified or augmented
